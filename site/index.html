        <h2>Letra</h2>
        <p>Each and every day Hiding from the sunshine Wandering in the shade Not too old, not too young Every night again Dancing with the moonlight Somewhere far away I can hear your call I'm out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause you can run but you can't hide I'm gonna make you mine Out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause I can feel how your flesh now Is crying out for more Ain't no fairytale What I see in your eyes Awaiting your mistake Not too close, not too far Sneaking in the pain Every truth becomes lie I won't trust myself Once I hear your call I'm out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause you can run but you can't hide I'm gonna make you mine Out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause I can feel how your flesh now Is crying out for more I'm out of my head Of my heart and my mind (Uh uh uh oh uh uh uh) Out of my head Of my heart and my mind (Uh uh uh oh uh uh uh) I'm out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause you can run but you can't hide I'm gonna make you mine Out of my head Of my heart and my mind 'Cause I can feel how your flesh now Is crying out for more...</p>
